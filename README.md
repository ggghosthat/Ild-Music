## History
In 2021 project has been started for educational purposes (learn programming). However I faced with 2 problems, that I had a lot of music file (primary mp3) and there was not any of tool to playback and enjoy on Windows and Linux with the same experience. In next year (2022) i decided to take upgrade and result was 0.6 version (see in release notes). But it still looked weired, so by this reason in May of 2024 I started redesign whole project for better experience.
